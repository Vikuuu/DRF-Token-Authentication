In this assignment, we have created **Django REST Framework** project that enables the User registeration and login using the **Token Authentication** system.

### Getting Started

cd dipear foods private limited
```

2. Create a new virtual environment:

```
# Let's first install the pipenv
pip install pipenv

#Now create the virtual environment
pipenv shell
```

3. Activate the environment:

```
# when called in the same directory as where virtual env is created,
# then it activates the virtual env
pipenv shell
```

4. Install the requirements:

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run Migrations:

```
py manage.py migrate
```

âš  Then, the development server will be started at `http://127:8000/`
